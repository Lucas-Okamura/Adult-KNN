# Machine Learning / Data Science Projects for University Classes

This repository contains data science / machine learning projects developed for a university class, using different algorithms to solve problems and analyse data. It was used the Adult database, obtained from UCI repository, which classifies if someone has an income greater or lesser than 50k with attributes like level of education, age, work class, occupation, among others.

Classes exercises were divided in parts:

**1.** Produce a classifier for the variable Target (that is, whether <=50K or >50K). The classifier must be a kNN where k is selected through cross validation; you must use the holdout test data to produce an empirical error rate. You must use the Jupyter system to produce a notebook with your solution. 

**2.** Produce another 4 classifiers, except KNN, for the variable Target (that is, whether <=50K or >50K).
